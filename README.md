The tool has mainly two part one is to check the test cases of the implemented example and one is to test the randomly generated value is to test 

### Part1:
   In this part we are implementing the Multiple condition coverage and Multiple condition decision coverage and actually we are calliung this method \
#### Tool used:
 Netbeans
#### Method :

JUnit testing
  
#### Driver Function:
       Driver function is responsible for the testing of different example that actually we want to to test
Actually ,
   when we trigeerd the function of the relative exam-le it will invoke the function and we have condition coverage result .

Just open the whole project in the Netbeans or eclipse maven project section and runt he file named
Testmain it show you a prompt for the user to select 1 or 2 which ever example he want just show the 
and when user select it will show the result according to the requirement.
 The result consisit of branches produce by randomy generated data and also the passed cover branches that actually want by the user.

#### Part2:
it just auto testing of the test cases of the function that actually to be tested.
it just triggered the function and will give you result  either passed or failed according to 
your logical implementation based upon expected output.
you can run it just by clicking on run test button in your ide i.e. Netbeans and Eclipse.
